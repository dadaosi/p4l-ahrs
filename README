st_LSM303_reader
----------------

This is a program for the Arduino which reads LMS303DLH 3-axis magnetometer and accellerometer, made by ST Micro.

I wrote this code as part of the Rutgers Autonomous Aircraft Team. A big thank you to ST Micro for donating eval boards to our project.

This sensor and code is used in the Paparazzi for Linux project:

Accellerometer and magnetometer readings are written to the serial port with the following NMEA style format:
$<sensor>,<axis>,<value>\r\n
using the following symbols:
$[A|M],[X|Y|Z],[-]?[0-9]+\r\n

For example:
$A,X,484
$M,Y,-399

Currently, some debugging information and the results of the sensor self-test is printed in a human-friendly format on boot. I'm working on better error handling code and a way to communicate exceptions over the serial link. 

The code currently reads at about 2Hz, as determined by a delay(500) call. I'll be improving the speed of the code soon by having it check the status registers of the accellerometer and magnetometer, which will be doing conversions at different rates.
