st_LSM303_reader
----------------

This is a program for the Arduino which reads LMS303DLH 3-axis magnetometer and accellerometer, made by ST Micro.

It sends the read values over the serial port with the following NMEA style format:
$<sensor>,<axis>,<value>\r\n
using the following symbols:
$[A|M],[X|Y|Z],[0-9]+\r\n

For example:
$A,X,484
$M,Y,399
